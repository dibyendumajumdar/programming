# Essays on Programming

I have been writing computer programs for many years. I have always struggled to find a resource where one 
can go and understand various aspects of programming. Most books focus on tools and languages, but programming is
much more than that. Here I would like to collect together some thoughts on programming that I have accumulated
over the years. Note that this will be an opinionated journey as it reflects my particular experience.

I decided to host this on github as I think this will allow others to contribute as well if they wish to. Having these essays in
version control will allow them to evolve over time, I need not worry about having completed pieces only.

Everything here is draft and unfinished.
