# Programming Lesson 1

## What is a program?

A program is a set of commands you write for the Computer to perform. The commands have to be written in a language that the Computer can understand. Popular languages are Java, Python, C, etc.

This course will use Python as the language.

We will later on see how the Computer understands a Python program, but for now, we will take it for granted.

## What are the main parts of a Computer?

In order to write a program for the Computer it is enough for us to know that the Computer has following parts:

1. CPU - this is the micro-processor such as Intel iCore 7 that performs the commands you give to the computer.
2. RAM or Memory - this is fast temporary area where the CPU can store information. This data is erased when you switch off the Computer.
3. Disk - this is where you can store information for longer period. Think of the disk as a notebook where you can write down stuff. The information on the disk will be available the next time you turn on the Computer.
4. Display or Console - this is the screen you use to view what the Computer is telling you. The Display is an output device of the Computer.
5. Mouse or track pad and keyboard - these are input devices of the Computer that you use to send instructions to the Computer.
6. Printer - this is an output device that you can send information to from the Computer, causing something to be printed out.

Here is a diagram showing the main components:

## Getting Started

We will use [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) to learn how to program. I suggest you download and install Thonny on your computer.

## First program

1. Start Thonny.
2. Type in following in the Window with title <untitled>.
```
  print('hello world')
```
3. Click File->Save to get the save window and save the file; name it `lesson1.py`.
3. Click F5 button (or the green run script button). 
  
The program should print 'hello world' in the Shell window.

You have written your first Python program.
